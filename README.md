# Restraint Collection And Adittions
Restraint Collection and Adittions is a Mod that i created for fun and to see what i could do, with zero experience with typescript and javascript (had to learn from scratch).
Is a mod for the game "Kinky Dungeon" by Strait Laced Games. (As i suck at basic drawing, im using the default game assets as much as i can)
Its my first ever mod that i developed, also my first ever project in a completely new programing language. if that was not engouth, its the first ever proyect that i decide to make public.
So if there are any issues like bugs, balance issues or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me either here, or tru discord.

> [!NOTE]
> Restraint Collection and Adittions can be better clasified as a Suite of Mods. each independent of each other, and fully compatible with each other.
> So you can choose wich part of the mod you want to add to your game (or just use them all)
